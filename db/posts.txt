With its ragged on-the-run look, the film itself has a street style as tough as the members of the Women''s Army. Scenes shift abruptly, cutting from trashy urbanscapes to the flicking video of incessant TV newscasts on the "deteriorating situation."A dose of sci-fi? Yes, but we instantly recognize the status-quo voice of the media, as well as a rich landscape of voices of our own. On Phoenix Radio, Honey talks, offering politics based on her intuitions and background. On Radio Regazza, Adele Bertei raps for the people who will chase any excitement.\r\nAnd the pages of the Socialist Youth Review speak in measured bourgeois intellectual phrases, defending the regime and avoiding the deficiencies of social-democratic policies on women and other "out" groups.

She began her painting apprenticeship most likely during the years 1605-10. She had access to many great works, which were works in progress during her lifetime, Carracci''s Farnese Gallery, Caravaggio''s paintings in the S. Luigi dei Francesi and the S. Maria del Popolo and frescoes by Guido Reni and Domenchino. It was difficult for women to become artists during this time, so fortunately for Artemisia, she was able to gain access to a world that would normally have been forbidden. Because of her father''s profession she came into contact with many artists working in Rome during these years. It is most likely that she would have personally known the artist Caravaggio. He was a colleague of her father and his works were popular in Rome at the time. She was also an acquaintance of Michelangelo Buonarotti the Younger, a great nephew of his namesake. These associations were most likely to have formed her most important artistic influences in later life.

The dress partly disintegrates in the course of the performance, trails of berry juice running down the woman''s body, the threads holding the dress together transforming into a pattern of veins on her skin. The juice dripping on to the floor, drawing a path of colored lines and puddles, tracking her movements, blending her physical motion with that of the others, recording a diagram, mapping the interaction between the woman and the crowd..... Voluptuously dressed, protected, exposing a seductive trait, an attractive inviting woman, then within minutes undressed, naked, the absurd clothing made out of edibles, a dress of berries melting - a moment covering the skin, hiding the body, then exposing it through a transformation, a visual superficiality, a vulnerable bareness, a shift, an illusion of exposing the inside on the outside, the scent of berries drenching the room as the woman makes her exit....... A renegotiation of a communicative situation raising a number of issues: - What is it to be dressed and how does our clothing facilitate certain communicative roles? - How are sensuous attraction, eroticism and sexuality replaced by unpleasant connotations to improper dress code, bodily fluids, and even to a forensic aesthetic? - What connotations surface when one realizes that the dress is made out of berries, something edible? - When and where during the course of the performance does the pleasant experience, both from the point of view of the performer and the audience, approach an unpleasant sensation-distressing, simultaneous possibly exciting, turn into apprehension and a somewhat disturbing incident? - Where and how do issues of illusion and reality surface in this process? - What role does the fragrance of the berries play as the dress falls apart and the scent intensifies? - How does physical and psychological proximity work as the performance proceeds? - How does the trail from the dripping dress relate to and communicate with the trails from other people stepping in the juices? - How does the work invoke and further explore issues raised by several of Marina Abramovic/Ulays works, by Jana Sterbak''s " Vanitas: Flesh Dress for Albino Anorectic" and how does it relate to the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ceciliedahl.com/', 'Cecilie Dahl  – Clothes For A Summer Hotel – 2004', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'cecilie-dahl-%e2%80%93-clothes-for-a-summer-hotel-%e2%80%93-2004', '', '', '2011-01-17 02:01:03', '2011-01-17 02:01:03', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=657', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Elizabeth Murray died in 2007 after a horrifying struggle with cancer, and this Sun and Moon was telling me a lot about her attitude against destiny: as her health was deteriorating, her appetite and enthusiasm for life were growing stronger. This shaped canvas was looking like a bag generously open, showing myriads of beauties and miracles. I wanted badly to take a photo: it was not allowed. I thought I would find the image on the web later.\r\n\r\nAnd I found it, only the image was missing the spatial geometry of the art work: it was liming it to bi-dimensional and all that great exuberance was lost!\r\n\r\nThe same happened with Bill Alley, a fine rendering of New York''s jazziness and of that special New York kind of joie d''vivre: that vital energy with a somehow perverse suggestion of visceral.\r\n\r\nOnly the web image of Jazz was keeping some of the artwork''s architecture, the flexible universe of paper and color, with joyful shapes and delicate abstract components: Phong Bui considers Elizabeth Murray was in her way undoing the rectilinear universe of Mondrian.\r\n\r\nI was last Sunday at the National Gallery and I found this Careless Love: the words of Phong Bui were coming again to my mind, about her visceral sense of the body.\r\n\r\nThis time it was allowed to take photos, and I also recorded a video, fascinated as I was by her art.\r\n\r\nCareless Love: here is what Elizabeth Murray said in her last interview (given to Rob Storr), there''s nothing like being in love!', 'Elizabeth Murray – A Homage To Elizabeth Murray – 2008', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'elizabeth-murray-%e2%80%93-a-homage-to-elizabeth-murray-%e2%80%93-2008', '', '', '2011-01-19 20:47:55', '2011-01-19 20:47:55', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=818', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In her work, she breaks away from the modernist abstract impulse, using the human figure as her subject matter.

She traces the cycle of life from birth to death to probe a complex array of human emotions—love, sexual desire, despair, and confusion. She also grapples with the “burden of the image” and the symbolic weight of classical modes of representation in Western art, such as the portrait and the nude; however, by working within and also transgressing these historical antecedents, Dumas effectively uses the human figure to explore and critique contemporary ideas of race, sexuality, and social identity.

Because of her unique style, Goodwin was sometimes described as the artist of mourning.\r\n"You can''t understand Canadian art without coming to terms with her achievements," said Matthew Teitelbaum, director of the Art Gallery of Ontario, which houses the largest collection of her work. "There was in her work an expressiveness about the quality of living and the emotion of life realized on a grand scale. One of her great achievements was to produce intimacy and grandeur at the same time. She was the ranking woman of her generation, who depicted fragility and triumph in the same breath. There is an affirmation of survival in her work, the bodies in her paintings work through and around obstacles."\r\n\r\nBetty Roodish, the daughter of Rumanian immigrants who owned a clothing business was born in Montreal on March 19, 1923, Her father died when she was 9. As a child, she didn''t fare well in school.\r\n"The only thing I was good at was making art, and back then that meant drawing geraniums," she once told a reporter. She studied graphic design at the Valentine Commercial School of Art and her first job was to design chocolate boxes for the Steinberg chain of grocery stores.\r\nExcept for one year when she took a printmaking course from Yves Gaucher at Sir George Williams University, Goodwin had no formal training as an artist.\r\n"The strange part is that I never said I am going to become an artist," she told a biographer, "I just kept going and persevered ... I have said it many times, you push and push and push, and there is a moment when the work begins to pull you."\r\n\r\nHer early works were strictly representational, vaguely Cubist. It wasn''t until 1960 when the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts exhibited 30 of her still lifes and gloomy portraits that her art making started to attract critical attention. In 1972, her textural studies of men''s vests and her enormous hanging works made out of battered tarpaulins earned her the Arts Council of Great Britain''s major prize at the Third International Print Biennale in Bradford, England.\r\nHandsome, elegant and intense, Goodwin was a tenacious artist. Her confidence in her work never flagged, and when success came, she accepted it without compromise. Her shows were planned thematically – there was the Vest series, The Swimmers, Icons and Diary of a Human Hand. In 1979, she and her assistant, Marcel Lemyre, turned an apartment at 4005 Mentana St. into a environmental sculpture.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, Goodwin was the first English-speaking Quebec artist to receive the Prix Paul Emile Borduas from the provincial government.\r\n"She was a giant, one of the first women to achive such stature in the contemporary Canadian art world," said the Montreal dealer René Blouin, who represented her work.\r\n"Her stature was so great, that she had a following even among people who didn''t pay much attention to art. She was a very private person, and while her work was rooted in autobiography, her work was a reflection of the temper of our times.\r\n"She wasn''t only lamenting the death of her son, Paul, (who died of a drug overdose in 1976) but the cruelty of the human condition that we see every day when we turn on the television."\r\nGoodwin was made an officer of the Order of Canada five years ago. Among her many other honours are doctorates from the Université de Montréal, The University of Guelph, and The University of Waterloo, as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Goodwin donated 150 of her works to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which has the largest collection of her work. The Gallery staged a major retrospective that year, and the same year she was awarded the Harold Town Prize.\r\nHer husband, Martin Goodwin, a civil engineer whom she married in 1945, died Oct. 15.\r\nIn keeping with her wishes, there will be no funeral.\r\nfrom Canada.com- http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=1027967', 'Betty Goodwin – Sleeping / Dying Woman – 1963', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'betty-goodwin-%e2%80%93-sleeping-dying-woman-%e2%80%93-1963', '', '', '2011-01-17 01:18:36', '2011-01-17 01:18:36', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=861', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Because of her unique style, Goodwin was sometimes described as the artist of mourning.\r\n"You can''t understand Canadian art without coming to terms with her achievements," said Matthew Teitelbaum, director of the Art Gallery of Ontario, which houses the largest collection of her work. "There was in her work an expressiveness about the quality of living and the emotion of life realized on a grand scale. One of her great achievements was to produce intimacy and grandeur at the same time. She was the ranking woman of her generation, who depicted fragility and triumph in the same breath. There is an affirmation of survival in her work, the bodies in her paintings work through and around obstacles."\r\n\r\nBetty Roodish, the daughter of Rumanian immigrants who owned a clothing business was born in Montreal on March 19, 1923, Her father died when she was 9. As a child, she didn''t fare well in school.\r\n"The only thing I was good at was making art, and back then that meant drawing geraniums," she once told a reporter. She studied graphic design at the Valentine Commercial School of Art and her first job was to design chocolate boxes for the Steinberg chain of grocery stores.\r\nExcept for one year when she took a printmaking course from Yves Gaucher at Sir George Williams University, Goodwin had no formal training as an artist.\r\n"The strange part is that I never said I am going to become an artist," she told a biographer, "I just kept going and persevered ... I have said it many times, you push and push and push, and there is a moment when the work begins to pull you."\r\n\r\nHer early works were strictly representational, vaguely Cubist. It wasn''t until 1960 when the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts exhibited 30 of her still lifes and gloomy portraits that her art making started to attract critical attention. In 1972, her textural studies of men''s vests and her enormous hanging works made out of battered tarpaulins earned her the Arts Council of Great Britain''s major prize at the Third International Print Biennale in Bradford, England.\r\nHandsome, elegant and intense, Goodwin was a tenacious artist. Her confidence in her work never flagged, and when success came, she accepted it without compromise. Her shows were planned thematically – there was the Vest series, The Swimmers, Icons and Diary of a Human Hand. In 1979, she and her assistant, Marcel Lemyre, turned an apartment at 4005 Mentana St. into a environmental sculpture.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, Goodwin was the first English-speaking Quebec artist to receive the Prix Paul Emile Borduas from the provincial government.\r\n"She was a giant, one of the first women to achive such stature in the contemporary Canadian art world," said the Montreal dealer René Blouin, who represented her work.\r\n"Her stature was so great, that she had a following even among people who didn''t pay much attention to art. She was a very private person, and while her work was rooted in autobiography, her work was a reflection of the temper of our times.\r\n"She wasn''t only lamenting the death of her son, Paul, (who died of a drug overdose in 1976) but the cruelty of the human condition that we see every day when we turn on the television."\r\nGoodwin was made an officer of the Order of Canada five years ago. Among her many other honours are doctorates from the Université de Montréal, The University of Guelph, and The University of Waterloo, as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Goodwin donated 150 of her works to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which has the largest collection of her work. The Gallery staged a major retrospective that year, and the same year she was awarded the Harold Town Prize.\r\nHer husband, Martin Goodwin, a civil engineer whom she married in 1945, died Oct. 15.\r\nIn keeping with her wishes, there will be no funeral.\r\nfrom Canada.com- http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=1027967', 'Betty Goodwin - Sleeping / Dying Woman - 1963', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '861-revision', '', '', '2011-01-16 20:56:20', '2011-01-16 20:56:20', '', 861, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=964', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In her work, she breaks away from the modernist abstract impulse, using the human figure as her subject matter. Both the physical reality of the human body and its symbolic value are emphasized in Dumas’s works. She traces the cycle of life from birth to death to probe a complex array of human emotions—love, sexual desire, despair, and confusion. She also grapples with the “burden of the image” and the symbolic weight of classical modes of representation in Western art, such as the portrait and the nude; however, by working within and also transgressing these historical antecedents, Dumas effectively uses the human figure to explore and critique contemporary ideas of race, sexuality, and social identity. On exhibition at The Menil Collection from 26 March through 21 June, 2009.\r\n\r\nMarlene Dumas: Measuring Your Own Grave is organized by The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) in association with The Museum of Modern Art, New York.  The exhibition will be accompanied by a major, fully illustrated catalogue, which provides a scholarly examination of the artist’s career. The publication will feature newly commissioned texts by Exhibition Curator Connie Butler, MOCA Director of Publications Lisa Mark, art historian Richard Shiff, artist Matthew Monahan, and writings by the artist.\r\n\r\nLocated in Houston’s Museum District, the Menil campus is anchored by Renzo Piano’s first American building.

The dress partly disintegrates in the course of the performance, trails of berry juice running down the woman''s body, the threads holding the dress together transforming into a pattern of veins on her skin. The juice dripping on to the floor, drawing a path of colored lines and puddles, tracking her movements, blending her physical motion with that of the others, recording a diagram, mapping the interaction between the woman and the crowd.....

A renegotiation of a communicative situation raising a number of issues: - What is it to be dressed and how does our clothing facilitate certain communicative roles? - How are sensuous attraction, eroticism and sexuality replaced by unpleasant connotations to improper dress code, bodily fluids, and even to a forensic aesthetic? - What connotations surface when one realizes that the dress is made out of berries, something edible? - When and where during the course of the performance does the pleasant experience, both from the point of view of the performer and the audience, approach an unpleasant sensation-distressing, simultaneous possibly exciting, turn into apprehension and a somewhat disturbing incident? - Where and how do issues of illusion and reality surface in this process? - What role does the fragrance of the berries play as the dress falls apart and the scent intensifies? - How does physical and psychological proximity work as the performance proceeds? - How does the trail from the dripping dress relate to and communicate with the trails from other people stepping in the juices? - How does the work invoke and further explore issues raised by several of Marina Abramovic/Ulays works, by Jana Sterbak''s " Vanitas: Flesh Dress for Albino Anorectic" and how does it relate to the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ceciliedahl.com/', 'Cecilie Dahl  - Clothes For A Summer Hotel - 2004', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '657-revision', '', '', '2011-01-12 01:36:10', '2011-01-12 01:36:10', '', 657, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1061', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

She was the eldest child of the painter Orazio Gentileschi and his wife Prudentia Montone. She was trained as an artist at an early age and she soon displayed a high skill of painting. She began her painting apprenticeship most likely during the years 1605-10. She had access to many great works, which were works in progress during her lifetime, Carracci''s Farnese Gallery, Caravaggio''s paintings in the S. Luigi dei Francesi and the S. Maria del Popolo and frescoes by Guido Reni and Domenchino. It was difficult for women to become artists during this time, so fortunately for Artemisia, she was able to gain access to a world that would normally have been forbidden. Because of her father''s profession she came into contact with many artists working in Rome during these years. It is most likely that she would have personally known the artist Caravaggio. He was a colleague of her father and his works were popular in Rome at the time. She was also an acquaintance of Michelangelo Buonarotti the Younger, a great nephew of his namesake. These associations were most likely to have formed her most important artistic influences in later life. She was strongly influenced by Tuscan idealism, Roman realism and Caravaggio''s chiaroscural naturalism.', 'Artemisia Gentileschi - Judith Beheading Holofernes - 1620', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '638-revision', '', '', '2011-01-11 23:38:25', '2011-01-11 23:38:25', '', 638, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1076', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The SRA''s act as ''portals'' on the Internet, helping users to fulfill their dreams. The SRA''s are nourished through touch. Because they were bred only with Rosetta''s DNA, they need the balance of an Y chromo or male sperm to survive. Rosetta projects seduction scenes from movie clips onto Ruby, which absorbs as she sleeps. The SRA''S can not distinguish dreams from reality. Ruby acts out these scenes in real life with the men and shares her spoils with her sisters. However, Ruby''s encounters suffer from impotence and unexplained rashes. Fearing a bio-gender war, the FBI sends in Agent Edward Hopper to solve the mystery. Puzzled, he turns for help from a private cyber detective. The men recover. Ruby falls in love and becomes impregnated by Sandy, a xerox shop worker. The characters struggle to find love in a world that no longer needs sex to reproduce, a world that is changing and is populated with people who use provisional identities and are seen through virtual selves and a world where love is the only thing that makes things real.

The SRA''s act as ''portals'' on the Internet, helping users to fulfill their dreams. The SRA''s are nourished through touch. Because they were bred only with Rosetta''s DNA, they need the balance of an Y chromo or male sperm to survive. Rosetta projects seduction scenes from movie clips onto Ruby, which absorbs as she sleeps. The SRA''S can not distinguish dreams from reality. Ruby acts out these scenes in real life with the men and shares her spoils with her sisters. However, Ruby''s encounters suffer from impotence and unexplained rashes. Fearing a bio-gender war, the FBI sends in Agent Edward Hopper to solve the mystery. Puzzled, he turns for help from a private cyber detective. The men recover. Ruby falls in love and becomes impregnated by Sandy, a xerox shop worker. The characters struggle to find love in a world that no longer needs sex to reproduce, a world that is changing and is populated with people who use provisional identities and are seen through virtual selves and a world where love is the only thing that makes things real.

For example, at times she cuts sound completely to emphasize the fact that she has the ability to manipulate what we are feeling.

The artwork consists of four enlarged velvet and organza dresses. The artist has deliberately used colors that would put your teeth on edge. Each one, installed on the large brick wall, cascades downward thirty-two feet. The overall effect is sensuous as the fabric appears to float on the stark white backdrop. These elongated forms seem to allude to the humanizing and animation of everyday objects and causes us to consider the women who might occupy these pieces of attire. As the artist states,"Like a perfect size 6000, the work is a link between the viewer''s body and massive architecture...This piece is a visual and tactile talisman of female form both ideal and gigantic." "In classical art the figure was the prototype for all proportion and measurement (...) clothes not only cover but are a substitute for the physical body." Semmes distorts the proportions of standard clothing sizes causing the work to look elongated and exaggerated. What results is a formal study of pattern, texture and color on a monumental scale. This strategy has been used by artists working in the tradition of surrealism and pop art. Semmes art also examines female stereotypes and issues of identity and gender. Semmes was born in Washington, D.C. and currently lives in New York City. She received an M.F.A. in Sculpture from the Yale School of Art, New Haven, CT. She has had solo exhibitions at: Centro per l''arte Contemporanea Luigi Pecci, Prato, Italy; Camden Arts Centre, London, England; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, PA; The Sculpture Center, New York and "Special Projects" The Institute for Contemporary Art, P.S.I Museum, Long Island City, NY. Her work has been included in numerous group exhibitions such as "American Art Today: Clothing as a Metaphor," The Art Museum, Florida International University Museum, Miami, FL and "First Sightings," Denver Art Museum, both in 1993. Semmes has also designed sets for the Mathilde Monnier Dance Company of Montpellier, France and is the recipient of many awards. 1994.52', 'Beverly Semmes – Rhonda Lavonda Yolonda Chiffonda,  – 1995', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'beverly-semmes-%e2%80%93-rhonda-lavonda-yolonda-chiffonda-%e2%80%93-1995', '', '', '2011-01-18 04:03:06', '2011-01-18 04:03:06', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1184', 0, 'post', '', 0),

With its declamatory title, “The Bodies Are Back,” British artist Margaret Harrison’s recent show issues a convincing rebuke to those who regard feminist art solely in the past tense or downplay the continued necessity of envisioning a world in which the balance of power no longer skews against women.\r\n\r\nThe “bodies” in question are mostly from around the time of Harrison’s first solo exhibition in 1971. British police deemed her drawings, particularly an image of Hugh Hefner as a near-nude Playboy bunny, “offensive,” and shut down the show. A re-creation of that piece (the original was stolen), He’s Only a Bunny Boy But He’s Quite Nice Really, is included in “Bodies,” as are original works and preparatory sketches, recent re-creations and photolithographs of other early pieces (many of the original incarnations have been lost)  and new works on paper that thematically connect with the older efforts. The effect is pronounced: “Bodies” is not a historical survey but rather a gathering of Harrison’s long-running commentary on the politics of representation.\r\n\r\nHarrison’s intention has frequently been to scramble the terms of John Berger’s famous formulation, “Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.” In watercolor, graphite and colored pencil, Harrison freely appropriates Vargas-style pinup art, comic books and commercial illustration, re-presenting the centerfolds, superheroes and models as regendered critiques of the visual sources she draws from. A watercolor riff on Captain America (1971/1997) depicts the WWII-era character in partial cheesecake-style drag, with garters, high heels and pendulous strap-on breasts. A series of 1971 watercolors, cheekily titled “Good Enough to Eat,” literalizes women-as-objects-to-be-consumed by sandwiching Betty Page clones between slices of bread.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/margaret-harrison/', 'Margaret Harrison – He’s Only A Bunny Boy But He’s Quite Nice Really – 1971/2010', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'margaret-harrison-%e2%80%93-he%e2%80%99s-only-a-bunny-boy-but-he%e2%80%99s-quite-nice-really-%e2%80%93-19712010', '', '', '2011-01-18 04:01:48', '2011-01-18 04:01:48', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1188', 0, 'post', '', 0),

For the first seven years of her work on it (1958-65), the painting occupied a bay window area in her apartment, with its back toward the main windows and light streaming in from the side windows. At first it was called Deathrose ("Death Throes", as Lucy Lippard noticed, "Death Rows," or "Death Rays"), with a burst of rays focused off-center like The Eyes. The painting at that point had an asymmetrical focal point into which everything vanished. But gradually, as DeFeo chipped away at it and added to it, the painting took on life, was centered on an even larger canvas, and ultimately became The Rose, nurtured by the light coming through the windows at its back and sides and the artist at its front. In his brilliant essay for the book that accompanies the show (Jay DeFeo and The Rose, Jane Green and Leah Levy, eds., University of California Press, 2003), Richard Cándida Smith writes, "She aimed for a revelation of the emergence of order, establishing its inescapable mystery by placing the source of the emergence in a physically impossible space on the other side of the canvas." The painting, in all its changes and thicknesses, is between two places, the universe outside the window and the one inside Jay DeFeo.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newyorkartworld.com/reviews/defeo.html', 'Jay Defeo – The Rose – 1958-66', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'jay-defeo-%e2%80%93-the-rose-%e2%80%93-1958-66', '', '', '2011-01-18 03:52:45', '2011-01-18 03:52:45', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1207', 0, 'post', '', 0),

For the first seven years of her work on it (1958-65), the painting occupied a bay window area in her apartment, with its back toward the main windows and light streaming in from the side windows. At first it was called Deathrose ("Death Throes", as Lucy Lippard noticed, "Death Rows," or "Death Rays"), with a burst of rays focused off-center like The Eyes. The painting at that point had an asymmetrical focal point into which everything vanished. But gradually, as DeFeo chipped away at it and added to it, the painting took on life, was centered on an even larger canvas, and ultimately became The Rose, nurtured by the light coming through the windows at its back and sides and the artist at its front. In his brilliant essay for the book that accompanies the show (Jay DeFeo and The Rose, Jane Green and Leah Levy, eds., University of California Press, 2003), Richard Cándida Smith writes, "She aimed for a revelation of the emergence of order, establishing its inescapable mystery by placing the source of the emergence in a physically impossible space on the other side of the canvas." The painting, in all its changes and thicknesses, is between two places, the universe outside the window and the one inside Jay DeFeo.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newyorkartworld.com/reviews/defeo.html', 'Jay Defeo - The Rose - 1958-66', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1207-revision', '', '', '2011-01-18 01:44:29', '2011-01-18 01:44:29', '', 1207, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1221', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

With its declamatory title, “The Bodies Are Back,” British artist Margaret Harrison’s recent show issues a convincing rebuke to those who regard feminist art solely in the past tense or downplay the continued necessity of envisioning a world in which the balance of power no longer skews against women.\r\n\r\nThe “bodies” in question are mostly from around the time of Harrison’s first solo exhibition in 1971. British police deemed her drawings, particularly an image of Hugh Hefner as a near-nude Playboy bunny, “offensive,” and shut down the show. A re-creation of that piece (the original was stolen), He’s Only a Bunny Boy But He’s Quite Nice Really, is included in “Bodies,” as are original works and preparatory sketches, recent re-creations and photolithographs of other early pieces (many of the original incarnations have been lost)  and new works on paper that thematically connect with the older efforts. The effect is pronounced: “Bodies” is not a historical survey but rather a gathering of Harrison’s long-running commentary on the politics of representation.\r\n\r\nHarrison’s intention has frequently been to scramble the terms of John Berger’s famous formulation, “Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.” In watercolor, graphite and colored pencil, Harrison freely appropriates Vargas-style pinup art, comic books and commercial illustration, re-presenting the centerfolds, superheroes and models as regendered critiques of the visual sources she draws from. A watercolor riff on Captain America (1971/1997) depicts the WWII-era character in partial cheesecake-style drag, with garters, high heels and pendulous strap-on breasts. A series of 1971 watercolors, cheekily titled “Good Enough to Eat,” literalizes women-as-objects-to-be-consumed by sandwiching Betty Page clones between slices of bread.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/margaret-harrison/', 'Margaret Harrison - He’s Only A Bunny Boy But He’s Quite Nice Really - 1971/2010', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1188-revision', '', '', '2011-01-17 23:23:55', '2011-01-17 23:23:55', '', 1188, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1242', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The artwork consists of four enlarged velvet and organza dresses. The artist has deliberately used colors that would put your teeth on edge. Each one, installed on the large brick wall, cascades downward thirty-two feet. The overall effect is sensuous as the fabric appears to float on the stark white backdrop. These elongated forms seem to allude to the humanizing and animation of everyday objects and causes us to consider the women who might occupy these pieces of attire. As the artist states,"Like a perfect size 6000, the work is a link between the viewer''s body and massive architecture...This piece is a visual and tactile talisman of female form both ideal and gigantic." "In classical art the figure was the prototype for all proportion and measurement (...) clothes not only cover but are a substitute for the physical body." Semmes distorts the proportions of standard clothing sizes causing the work to look elongated and exaggerated. What results is a formal study of pattern, texture and color on a monumental scale. This strategy has been used by artists working in the tradition of surrealism and pop art. Semmes art also examines female stereotypes and issues of identity and gender. Semmes was born in Washington, D.C. and currently lives in New York City. She received an M.F.A. in Sculpture from the Yale School of Art, New Haven, CT. She has had solo exhibitions at: Centro per l''arte Contemporanea Luigi Pecci, Prato, Italy; Camden Arts Centre, London, England; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, PA; The Sculpture Center, New York and "Special Projects" The Institute for Contemporary Art, P.S.I Museum, Long Island City, NY. Her work has been included in numerous group exhibitions such as "American Art Today: Clothing as a Metaphor," The Art Museum, Florida International University Museum, Miami, FL and "First Sightings," Denver Art Museum, both in 1993.

Trihn calls into question the conventions of the documentary and how such films have the power to manipulate the way in which the audience sees. She constantly reminds her audience that they are watching a movie through many filmic techniques. For example, at times she cuts sound completely to emphasize the fact that she has the ability to manipulate what we are feeling. By taking away the music (African drumming in this case), a tool filmmakers often rely on to tell us how we SHOULD be feeling, we are left to our own devices and must figure out on our own what we are seeing, what it means to us, and why.

In doing so, she follows the transgressive logic of «devouring» and «vomiting». The reception of «Baba antropofágica» («Cannibalistic Saliva») also relies on the documentary film «O mundo de Lygia Clark,» filmed by Eduardo Clark in 1973. But escaping this phantasmal staging of the body seems almost impossible: kneeling over a guinea-pig-like subject lying on the floor, a figure pulls from its mouth—like spiders do from their bodies—a spittle-drenched thread and spins a cocoon around the reclining figure. The precarious division of subject and object is eliminated by this thread-like weaving, with the gestural webbing of the passive subject completing the inversion of the internal and external. In the retrospective, these interactive aspects might have been what was most convincing. In contrast to Performance and Body Art, Lygia Clark understood herself to be an initiator of processes, and was most successful in this respect when her haptic attempts on orderings were targeted at inter-subjective body politics. \r\n(Source: Petra Löffler, «Lygia Clark, The Inside is the Outside», \r\n\r\nhttp://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/baba-antropofagica/\r\n \r\n', 'Lygia Clark – Baba Antropofágica – 1973', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'lygia-clark-%e2%80%93-baba-antropofagica-%e2%80%93-1973', '', '', '2011-01-19 04:37:52', '2011-01-19 04:37:52', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1276', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In doing so, she follows the transgressive logic of «devouring» and «vomiting». The reception of «Baba antropofágica» («Cannibalistic Saliva») also relies on the documentary film «O mundo de Lygia Clark,» filmed by Eduardo Clark in 1973. But escaping this phantasmal staging of the body seems almost impossible: kneeling over a guinea-pig-like subject lying on the floor, a figure pulls from its mouth—like spiders do from their bodies—a spittle-drenched thread and spins a cocoon around the reclining figure. The precarious division of subject and object is eliminated by this thread-like weaving, with the gestural webbing of the passive subject completing the inversion of the internal and external. In the retrospective, these interactive aspects might have been what was most convincing. In contrast to Performance and Body Art, Lygia Clark understood herself to be an initiator of processes, and was most successful in this respect when her haptic attempts on orderings were targeted at inter-subjective body politics. \r\n(Source: Petra Löffler, «Lygia Clark, The Inside is the Outside», \r\n\r\nhttp://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/baba-antropofagica/\r\n \r\n', 'Lygia Clark - Baba Antropofágica - 1973', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1276-revision', '', '', '2011-01-18 05:20:42', '2011-01-18 05:20:42', '', 1276, 'http://184.106.93.224/1276-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Her mother''s mental problems meant that she was brought up by her maternal grandmother, Mathilde Cahun.\r\n\r\nShe began making photographic self-portraits as early as 1912, when she was just eighteen years old, and she continued taking images of herself through the 1930s.\r\n\r\nAround 1919, she settled on the pseudonym Claude Cahun, intentionally selecting a sexually ambiguous name, after having previously used the names Claude Courlis and Daniel Douglas. During the early twenties, she settled in Paris with her life-long partner and stepsister Suzanne Malherbe. For the rest of their lives together, Cahun and Malherbe (who adopted the pseudonym Marcel Moore) collaborated on various written works, sculptures, photomontages and collages. She published articles and novels, notably in the periodical "Mercure de France", and befriended Henri Michaux, Pierre Morhange and Robert Desnos.\r\n\r\nAround 1992 she and Malhrbe began holding artists'' salons at their home. Among the regulars who would attend were artists Henri Michaux and André Breton and literary entrepeneurs Sylvia Beach and Adrienne Monnier.[1]\r\n\r\nThroughout her life, she worked on a series of monologues called "Heroines," which was based upon female fairy tale characters and intertwining them with witty comparisons to the contemporary image of women. In 1929, a photograph of her was published in the journal Bifur. The following year, her autobiographical essay Aveux non avenus, illustrated with photomontages, was published by Carrefour.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her writing, she is most remembered for her highly staged self-portraits and tableaux that incorporated the visual aethetics ofSurrealism.\r\n\r\nIn 1932 she joined the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires, where she met André Breton and René Crevel. Following this, she started associating with the surrealist group, and later participated in a number of surrealist exhibitions, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition (New Burlington Gallery) and Exposition surréaliste d''Objets (Charles Ratton Gallery, Paris), both in 1936. In 1934, she published a short polemic essay, Les Paris sont Ouverts, and in 1935 took part in the founding of the left-wing group Contre Attaque, alongside André Breton and Georges Bataille.\r\n\r\nIn 1937 Cahun and Malherbe settled in Jersey. Following the outbreak of World War 2 and the German invasion, they became active as resistance fighters and propagandists. Fervently against war, the two worked extensively in producing anti-German fliers. Many were snippets from English-to-German translations of BBC reports on the Nazi''s crimes and insolence, which were pasted together to create rhythmic poems and harsh criticism. The couple then dressed up and attended many German military events in Jersey, strategically placing them in soldier''s pockets, on their chairs, etc. Also, fliers were inconspicuously crumpled up and thrown into cars and windows. In many ways, Cahun and Malherbe''s resistance efforts were not only political but artistic actions, using their creative talents to manipulate and undermine the authority which they despised. In many ways, Cahun''s life''s work was focused on undermining a certain authority, however her specific resistance fighting targeted a physically dangerous threat. In 1944 they were arrested and sentenced to death, but the sentences were never carried out. However, Cahun''s health never recovered from her treatment in jail, and she died in 1954.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Cahun''s life was marked by a sense of role reversal, and her public identity became a commentary upon not only her own, but the public''s notions of sexuality, gender, beauty, and logic. Her adoption of a sexually ambiguous name, and her androgynous self-portraits display a revolutionay way of thinking and creating, experimenting with her audience''s understanding of photography as a documentation of reality. Her poetry challenged gender roles and attacked the increasingly modern world''s social and economic boundaries. Also Cahun''s participation in the Parisian Surrealist movement diversified the group''s artwork and ushered in new representations. Where most Surrealist artists were men, and their primary images were of women as isolated symbols of eroticism, Cahun epitomized the chameleonic and multiple possibilities of the female identity. Her photographs, writings, and general life as an artistic and political revolutionary continue to influence countless artists, namely Cindy Sherman and Nan Goldin.', 'Claude Cahun – Various Works – 1912-54', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'claude-cahun-%e2%80%93-various-works-%e2%80%93-1912-54', '', '', '2011-01-19 18:21:31', '2011-01-19 18:21:31', '', 0, 'http://184.106.93.224/?p=1394', 0, 'post', '', 0),

She is best known for her work of the Weimar period, when she was one of the originators of photomontage.\r\nShe was born Johanne Höch in Gotha, Germany. From 1912 to 1914 she studied at the College of Arts and Crafts in Berlin under the guidance of Harold Bergen. She studied glass design and graphic arts, rather than fine arts, to please her father. She worked for the Red Cross in 1914, at the start of World War I. In 1915 she entered the graph class of the National Institute of the Museum of Arts and Crafts. Also in 1915, Höch began an influential friendship with Raoul Hausmann, a member of the Berlin Dada movement. Höch''s involvement with the Berlin Dadists began in earnest in 1919. After her schooling, she worked in the handicrafts department for Ullstein Verlang. The influence of this early work and training can clearly be seen in her later work involving references to dress patterns and textiles. From 1926 to 1929 she lived and worked in the Netherlands. Höch made more influential friendships over the years, with Kurt Schwitters and Piet Mondrian among others.

While this was the first crucial relationship to have an influence on Höch''s artistic work, she often reflected upon her relationships in such pieces as Love (1926).

Hausmann was married to another woman during their involvement, and refused to marry Höch. She supported women''s right to reproductive control; she had two abortions during her involvement with Hausmann. Hausmann was physically abusive. Höch and Hausmann separated in 1922, at which point Höch was well on her way to becoming an artist in her own right, independent of her involvement with Hausmann.

Elizabeth Murray died in 2007 after a horrifying struggle with cancer, and this Sun and Moon was telling me a lot about her attitude against destiny: as her health was deteriorating, her appetite and enthusiasm for life were growing stronger. This shaped canvas was looking like a bag generously open, showing myriads of beauties and miracles. I wanted badly to take a photo: it was not allowed. I thought I would find the image on the web later.\r\n\r\nAnd I found it, only the image was missing the spatial geometry of the art work: it was liming it to bi-dimensional and all that great exuberance was lost!\r\n\r\nThe same happened with Bill Alley, a fine rendering of New York''s jazziness and of that special New York kind of joie d''vivre: that vital energy with a somehow perverse suggestion of visceral.\r\n\r\nOnly the web image of Jazz was keeping some of the artwork''s architecture, the flexible universe of paper and color, with joyful shapes and delicate abstract components: Phong Bui considers Elizabeth Murray was in her way undoing the rectilinear universe of Mondrian.\r\n\r\nI was last Sunday at the National Gallery and I found this Careless Love: the words of Phong Bui were coming again to my mind, about her visceral sense of the body.\r\n\r\nThis time it was allowed to take photos, and I also recorded a video, fascinated as I was by her art.\r\n\r\nCareless Love: here is what Elizabeth Murray said in her last interview (given to Rob Storr), there''s nothing like being in love!', 'Elizabeth Murray - A Homage To Elizabeth Murray - 2008', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '818-revision', '', '', '2011-01-14 23:54:22', '2011-01-14 23:54:22', '', 818, 'http://184.106.93.224/818-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Women, lesbians and minorities who were instrumental in the transformation of society are losing their jobs: a familiar last-hired \/first-fired scenario which feeds their doubts about the practical impact of this \"revolution.\" On the day a pacifying wages for housework policy is announced, a coalition of women led by Flo Kennedy takes over a national news cast to dramatize the suspicious prison death of Adelaide Norris, leader of the Women's Army.\r\nIn this her first narrative feature film, editor and ex-art critic\/painter Lizzie Borden creates a kaleidoscope portrait of women splintered into dozens of different political factions. With its ragged on-the-run look, the film itself has a street style as tough as the members of the Women's Army. Scenes shift abruptly, cutting from trashy urbanscapes to the flicking video of incessant TV newscasts on the \"deteriorating situation.\"A dose of sci-fi? Yes, but we instantly recognize the status-quo voice of the media, as well as a rich landscape of voices of our own. On Phoenix Radio, Honey talks, offering politics based on her intuitions and background. On Radio Regazza, Adele Bertei raps for the people who will chase any excitement.\r\nAnd the pages of the Socialist Youth Review speak in measured bourgeois intellectual phrases, defending the regime and avoiding the deficiencies of social-democratic policies on women and other \"out\" groups.
